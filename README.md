# Northwind Business Analytics

## Foreword
The work contained in this repository is an example of a business analysis that I performed using the famous (if not ancient) Northwind Trading Company sql database. The notebook details my process in approaching the analysis with the stakeholders in mind, which is reflected in the "Business Presentation" also found in this repository. I highlight my ability to perform statistical analyses in both frequentist and bayesian frameworks to answer questions that have bearing on the functioning of the company. My recommendations are given in brief in the business presentation.
