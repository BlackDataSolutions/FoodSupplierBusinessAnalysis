It is customary to set $\\alpha$ at 0.05, which indicates that we must have \"95% confidence\" in rejecting our assumptions. The $\\alpha$ value represents more than our confidence; it represents the likelihood of Type I error (and by extension the Type II error), the probability of producing the current findings in a prescribed probability distribution, and a measure of the difference between samples (or groups of samples) given a standard deviation. An $\\alpha$ value of 0.05 balances Type I and Type II errors, and represents almost 4 standard deviations to the left and right of the expected value as prescribed in the null hypothesis. $\\alpha$ = 0.05 will be used for the entirety of this anaylsis.\n",

The null hypothesis is thus the relationship that we want to claim is **False** between our two samples. Rejecting the null hypothesis does not mean that we accept the alternative hypothesis. It simply means that we reject the null hypothesis and offer the alternative hypothesis as a reasonable alternative.

This test is equivalent to asking if a certain drug helps lower blood pressure in a group of people.

Since items are ordered in different quantities, it is impossible to know if a given discount has broken even, increased profits, or decreased profits.

    "In order to use Bayes theorem, I must specify a prior distribution. The prior distribution is our belief as to how the system behaves. It is important to choose a prior that will not bias the results, since a poorly formed prior can greatly influence the outcome. Given that we do not have data on whether or not shipping times increase order volume for other companies, the prior that I specify cannot assume that there **is** a difference. In fact, I will specify a prior that assumes that there **is no difference** between the two datasets by using the mean and standard deviation of the joined set. I will use a poisson distribution as the prior with $\\lambda$ set to the maximum likelihood, $\\bar{X}$, since the data describes the likely time that it takes for a package to arrive.  This is exactly what Poisson was built for, and the histogram certainly looks like a poisson distribution.<br><br>\n",
    "Additionally, I'll choose my cutoff at four days. From the description of the data, 25% of all orders are filled in four days, which is half the time as the expected value and leaves me with more than enough data to model. Bayesian models usually require less data to have the same statistical power since prior information is known about the system and monte carlo methods can be used to leverage the little amount of data that is available."
